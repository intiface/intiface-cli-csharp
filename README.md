Command Line Interface for running Intiface servers.

Basically just a front-end for Buttplug C#, but since we're trying to
not make people install a program named "Buttplug" on their computers,
here we are.

While this program can be used standalone, it will mostly be featured
as a backend/engine for Intiface Desktop.

## A Note About Versioning

Versions of the Intiface CLI have Major/Minor/Patch semvers that track
the version of buttplug-csharp library they depend on. Any changes to
the intiface CLI program itself will be build versions tacked on the
end of that range.
